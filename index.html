<h1>The Backend Engineer Track</h1>
<p>
I developed this track to help in your backend journey. Whether you are just getting started in the backend, have some basic knowledge and want to sharpen it, or you are adept in backend fundementals and want some challenging backend topics, I have something for you. The following are three ordered <a href ='https://www.youtube.com/HusseinNasser-software-engineering'>YouTube</a> playlists below, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. I think this will help you consume the content at your pace. The levels are assigned based on my personal assessment. The videos are recommended to be consumed in the order of the playlist. Thank you so much for the love and support. <br> -Hussein
